6.7.9
---------------------------
- Corrected another error in the spell cast watcher; "StopCastAnimationOnNameplate" is now properly referenced.  This only affects arena matches.  I don't do arenas, so this was never properly tested.  Let me know if more errors pop up.

6.7.8
---------------------------
- Corrected a typo in the spell cast watcher; "StartCastAnimation" is now properly, "StartCastAnimationOnNameplate".  Arena fans rejoice!

6.7.7
---------------------------
- Fixed: Monk Tank mode (Stance of the Sturdy Ox stance added to the shapeshift list)
- Corrected various threat values coming into the threat line widget 
- Core: extended plate verification process
- Removed many unneeded local variables
- Combed files for any "_" that could be global

6.7.6
---------------------------
- Added code to verify healthmax values.
- Sets framelevel to 0.  Targetted plates are raised to 1, which still does obscure the chatbox and minimap.  This also occurs with the standard Blizz nameplates, and cannot be corrected without raising the strata or level of those other frames.  
- Added a rudimentary localization framework.  To use: Create an addon named, "TidyPlatesHubXX" where the XX is the last two letters of the localization code.  Ex. "TidyPlatesHubDE".  Within the code for that addon, create a table called, 'TidyPlatesHubLocalization', and add the translations.  For example:
TidyPlatesHubLocalization["Style"] = "Translation of STYLE".   See TidyPlatesHub\Lists.lua for an example.  Future versions will add a "Dump" mode for outputting all the text that needs translating.
- Changed the background, anchoring, and font sizes in the Hub, for readability.
- Changed the core template, and added a 'default' style, which looks like the Blizzard nameplates.  (will be useful in a future version)


6.7.5
---------------------------
- Removed framestrata code from, MinimapCluster, PlayerFrame, and TargetFrame
- Threat Line Widget:  Shootin' from the hip, again.

6.7.4
---------------------------
- Fixed giant threat bar issue (Corrected group size ranges in GetRelativeThreat() utility function)
- Raised MinimapCluster, PlayerFrame, and TargetFrame to "LOW" framestrata to prevent nameplates from obscuring those UI elements.
- Currently, there is no way to fix the brief 'flash' of the Blizzard nameplate art before it becomes active; It's a bug for the Blizz folks to solve.

6.7.3
---------------------------
- Removed debug code from GroupCache.lua (Chat log spam)


6.7.2
---------------------------
- Aura Widget: Fixed error, where certain auras filtered by spellid were not being displayed.
- Group Cache: Fixed updates for friendly group class colors (hopefully!)
- Group & Unit Cache: Will not try to search the global unit cache for class information while you are in a dungeon (could slow things down, and it isn't needed)
- Core: Reverted to earlier method of discriminating nameplates
- Threat Line Widget: Added some code to prevent it from accidentally becoming REALLY long.

6.7.1
---------------------------
- Fixed Range Widget bug

6.7 
---------------------------
Beta9:
	- Upgraded the TOC file version number to 50001
	- Added: TidyPlates:EnableFadeIn() and TidyPlates:DisableFadeIn() functions, to control the nameplate fade-in mechanic.  Default is Enabled.

Beta8:
	- Removed debug console output

Beta7: r506
	- Added "Stance of the Sturdy Ox" to the Tank Aura list.  This should fix some "By Threat" oddities.
	- Added Monk specs to the HealerTrack widget.
	- Added PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD to Tank watcher events (to fix the line 39: nil errors)
	- (hopefully) fixed pauses while using the Arena mode with the Spell Cast Warning system
	
	- Jinx:
		- Right now, it looks like the debuff is applied by the server, not Your Character.  This is important because Tidy Plates ignores debuffs without a source.  In the beta, this debuff is properly displayed.

Beta6:
	- Capacitor Totem
	
Beta5:
	- Fixed: Bug where current theme selection would be lost when logging-in.

Beta4:
	- Added BUFFS to the aura widget.  
	- Added texture coordinate function to tidyplates statusbar widget.  Usage/Example: healthbar.left = 0, healthbar.right = 1, healthbar.bottom = 0, healthbar.top = 1

Beta3:
	- The most visible change in Beta3 is the rearrangement of the Hub panel.  The debuff widget has been moved to its own category.
	- I've been working on a new way to control the health bar style.  I'm not sure when/if this code will become active.  I will probably post it as an alpha version after 6.7 is released.
	
	
Beta2:
What have I done so far?
	- Enhanced both the debuff widget and the spell cast warning module with support for Arena unitid event capture (via the standard event system, rather than the combat log).
	- Updated to MoP standards (which will work with 4.3, too)
		- Functions which have been renamed for MoP have been replaced by an internal function (provided by Tidy Plates) which is aware of the current client version, and will choose the appropriate function.
		- Tidy Plates now uses an internal button template, which replaces the UIPanelButtonTemplate2, which was removed in MoP
	
	
			
Testing
	- Need to test the Arena-Mode enhancements for the Debuff widget and Cast Warning system
	


Beta1 (r485)
	- Will do this later, too tired


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tidy Plates 6.6

6.6.2 (r465)
	- Fixed UnitCache Toolip 'nil' error 

6.6.1 (r464)
	- Modified Unit Description Caching to work properly with addons that change the color of the tooltip text. (Like elvUI)
	- The Hub checks to see if the user has enabled any of the Aggro or 'By Threat' features, and automatically enables Blizz's Threat Warning feature. (which is required)

6.6.0
	- Under the "Style" category, all references to "Text-Only Plates" or "TextPlates" have been changed to "Headline Mode".  This change is intended to distinguish the style modifier from other references to "Text".  I'm sure some of you will hate this (can you come up with something better?), but I'm hoping that less cranky folks find the new grammar to be more intuitive.
	- To support the "Headline Mode" name change, I've added a new category.  Can you guess?  It's, "Headline".  
	- I've grouped the "Color" and "Text" categories into "Color & Text", and moved them to the second-category position.  Why??  1: "Color & Text" controls the appearance of the default 'Health Bar' style.  2: Underneath, "Headline" controls the appearance of the 'No Bar' style.  Thus: This arrangement puts these options close to where the user selects the modes, in the "Style" category.
	- Square Debuff Icon Option: Added a new Debuff Widget option, "Debuff Style", which allows the user to select between the traditional "Wide" debuff format, or a more squareish "Compact" style.  The column count is increased to 5 for the "Compact" style.
	- Bookmark System: Added a "Bookmark" system to the Hub panels, which allows a user to jump directly to any of the categories
	- On certain themes, the position of your debuffs will be adjusted to allow the combo point widget to comfortably fit (on Rogues and Druids, only).  When the combo widget is disabled, the icons will "snug" themselves closer to the plate. 
	- Using the '/hub' command will bring you to the Hub Configuration panel for your current theme
	- Added click sounds to the 'Copy' and 'Paste' buttons
	- Bug fixes and Memory optimization
	- Added a Prefilter option for the debuff widget cache
		* The hub enables the prefilter, when you're using the 'By Prefix" mode
		* Debuffs NOT on your list are not cached
		* This should save a ton of memory if you're using 'By Prefix'
	- Made some changes to the Unit Data Cache system to reduce memory use, and avoid certain 'lag' events...
		* Pet/Companion NPC titles are no longer cached
		* Cached unit guild and npc titles are now stored within the TidyPlatesWidgetData variable, keeping this data out of the base TidyPlates saved variables
		* Hub/Reset button will now clear the cached unit descriptions/titles and guilds
		* Unit descriptions (player guild name, or NPC role/title) will not be displayed while in an instance.  This is to avoid the CPU overhead that occurs when searching the database, which could be THOUSANDS of entries.  This is a direct cause for massive FPS drop, in some cases.
		* A side-effect of these changes is the clearing of user's stored guild names and NPC titles.  This is required to get the desired performance benefits.
	- Matched widget duration timer to default blizz interface standard (using 'floor' rather than 'ceil') 
	- Fixed SpellId variable name in widgets\tank.lua
	- Spell Cast Monitor: If cast time is not greater than 0, make it a minimum of 1.5s
	- Added NameColorByEnemyClass
	- Minimize Hub now scale to 85%
	- Rearranged Name Color: By Friendly/Enemy class
	- Improved HealerTrack.lua, with help from Curseforge user, dakunesu.  Improves detection of healers in battlegrounds! Rockin!
	- Added a "Minimize" button to the /hub UI panel.  Clicking this will detach the Hub panel from the Interface Options window, and make it smaller.  Good for configuring stuff while playing.
	- The Copy & Paste buttons for the Hub panels now work with a unified Clipboard, so you can Copy & Paste between Tank and DPS panels.  Holding down "Shift" while clicking Copy or Paste will use the original Tank/DPS-specific caches.
	- New Hub Option: "Bring Casting Units to Spotlight Scale"
	- Unit Cache should filter out reputation names.  This fixes an issue occuring when "Colorblind" mode is active, causing Reputation to be displayed instead of an NPC's Title.
	- "Filter > Filter Inactive": When a unit is marked with a target/raid-icon, it's now assumed to be Active.
	- And more (ie. stuff I've forgotten about)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tidy Plates 6.5

	* The caching system will peek at /who requests, and store the info on the Unit-Data table (Unless it's disabled)
	* Changed Neon's font to Accidental Presidency (Why?  Because I like it!)

(r406)
	* When "Show Party Aggro" (under Threat) is enabled, the "By Threat" spotlight systems for Opacity and Scale will now highlight your unfortunate party members.
	* The Health and Text colors mode, "By Threat" has been changed to, "By Threat (Auto-Detect).  The previous implementation has been renamed to "By Threat (Legacy)"

-----------------
6.4...
		
(r363)
- Fixed: Re-Added unit.spellIsShielded to cast color delegate

(r358)
- Added: Tip text next to Hub Debuff widget config
- Fixed: Friendly Group unit class coloring
- Re-removed: Minimap button.  The code is still there, but hidden.  If you liked the button, use this command:   /run TidyPlatesOptions._EnableMiniButton = true; ReloadUI()

(r355)
- Fixed: List-to-lookup table conversion for Unit Filter, By Name
- Fixed: Hub/Tank slider ranges (They were not actually broken, just different from the Damage Hub)

(r350)

- Fixed: Hub Tank Panel, SplitToTable error

(r348)
- More messing around with debuff widget

(r340)
- Fix for Debuff Widget empty table/sort error
- Corrected a mistyped line for indexing Aura_Dispell type

(r338)
- Debuff Priority works for "Show Specific" and "Show My Specific" modes, in addition to "By Prefix"
- Class Icon Widget: Returned to using internal artwork
- All textures are now Non-blocking (the game won't wait for textures to load into memory before it draws the scene), preventing texture changes from affecting frame rate
- The debuff widget (should now be called Aura Widget) will track buffs for friendly players

(r308)
- Debuff widget now uses single dimension tables to store cached data, to improve memory management
- Moved Widgets to their own addon/folder (For memory usage tracking)
- Statusbar gradients are now supported via additional return values in theme.SetHealthbarColor()... 
	* return r1, g1, b1, [r2, g2, b2]

	* return showThisAura, auraPriority 
- The Hub Panels will check the order of the debuffs in its list to determine priority.
- Class Widget no longer uses internal class artwork; Instead, the class icon is pulled from the Blizz UI library.
- If theme.SetCastbarColor returns nil, the cast animation will be skipped
	* This can be used to filter spell casting data

6.3
-----------------

6.3.8 (r307)

6.3.4 (r293)
- More Debuff Widget fixes
- Improved Debuff Widget memory usage

- Fixed: Crazy debuffs during Firelands dailies.
- Aurainstance table (for debuff widget) and functions have been converted to a smarter format
- When auras are updated on your current target, the caching function will clear the cache before it repopulates the list.

- Added nil value error protection to debuff prefix sorter

6.3.0 (r284) 55,754
	* Updated functions for 4.2
	* Increased width of sliders in Hub
	* Opacity functions now use a transfer function to correct the opacity (currently, .5 does not translate to 50% opaque; it's more like 65%)
	* Channeled spells now move the cast bar in reverse.
	* Friendly/Enemy "V-key" Automation; In Combat, Out of Combat, Always
	* Debuff widget now Caches texture of debuffs (to fix sunfire phenomenon, and similar)

	- This new category has two menus for Friendly and Enemy nameplates
	- Users can select between two styles (Health Bars vs Text Only), and several different visibility conditions.
	- If you use the Text Only bars, you might want to check out the Name Text Color options, to spice up that text!
* Spell Cast Monitor name search will now strip the "-" from the combat log name, which should fix PvP cast association issues.
* Debuff Widget will now strip the "-" from combat log events, which should fix pvp association issues
* fixed a 'nil' error during pet/tank association
* "Avoid Overlap" has been updated for the new CVar types
* Fixed a bug where the debuff widget was not getting the correct data from the combat log

6.1
-------------

6.1.13
	- tweaked name color function

		- ALL, MY, NO, OTHER, CC
		- Using CC will eventually highlight the debuff on the widget, but for now it just acts as "ALL"
		
	- Fixed UnitChannelInfo interruptable spell argument bug
	- Found a bug; The Editboxes contained in my ScrollFrames seem to invisibly extend past the bottom of the scrollframe, which can block underlying UI controls.  I've dropped the editboxes to a lower frame level, which is a hack method of preventing problems with it interferring with controls anchored to the bottom of the scrollframe.  Will attempt to figure out a better solution.
	- Name text coloring modes
	- By Raid Icon modes for Opacity and Scale
	
6.1.8 (r227)

	- Added Health Text option: Approximate Health (will show 2 decimal places for thousands (k) and millions (M), with suffix)
	- Added Text option, "Use Default Blizzard Font"; This will use the font defined by the global variable, 'NAMEPLATE_FONT'.  This should improve the situation for non-latin charcter sets (this is for you, Chinese, Russians, Taiwanese, and Koreans.. xoxo)	

6.1.7
	- Changed from thousand/million suffix for health text to using a thousands seperator
	- Restored PTR support (last time I checked)
	- Moved Quatre Raid Icon to similar position as Neon (to left side of health bar)

6.1.6
	- Added Events for UNIT_SPELLCAST_NOT_INTERRUPTIBLE, UNIT_SPELLCAST_INTERRUPTIBLE, (This hopefully improves the situation for spells that are uninterruptible being misrepresented)
	- Added Threat Wheel to Hub
	- Reverted to original health % mode (does not show % when full health)
	- WoW 4.1 Compatibility (works on 4.0.x and 4.1)

	- Added Events for UNIT_SPELLCAST_NOT_INTERRUPTIBLE, UNIT_SPELLCAST_INTERRUPTIBLE
	- Added Threat Wheel to Hub/function set

	- WoW 4.1 Compatibility (should work on 4.0.x and 4.1, concurrently.  I have not tested on the PTR, though)
	


r199	- Raid Tank Coloring in Tank mode.  Automatically used when in "By Threat" Modes.  
		- Theme list is now Alphabetized

			- 'shift-clicking' will still clear the tables and reload the ui
		- First-run config, turns off friendly nameplates by default
		- Added a link to the Blizzard "Names" panel via the Tidy Plates theme chooser panel
		
r186	- Default Hub Values changed to more closely resemble 6.0.8 defaults  (Blue, Orange Scheme, Threat Warning Glow/Triangles turned On)  
			- A variable reset may be required to revert to the defaults
		- First-run config, "friendly unit bug" fix

TidyPlatesWidgets:GetThreatCondition(name)
- Removed the troubleshooting panel.
- Changed "Notes" in TOC

unit.spellIsShielded = notInterruptible
			
r92-100:
- The LoadTheme function is now accessible to external software, via: TidyPlates.LoadTheme("name").

- The theme loader will call the theme.OnActivateTheme with nil values for ALL themes when a theme is changed.  See the Neon/Tank functions.lua for how and why it's supposed to be used.
- Numerous bug fixes
- The new casting system has been finished.  Neon/Tank will activate it automatically, but you can use '/run TidyPlates:StartSpellCastWatcher()' to enable it for any theme.


r70: 
- Massive changes.  Your themes may not work...

- Preliminary Spell Cast Monitor, in place.  Not yet activated.  You can find this code under the widget folder, in SpellCastMonitor.lua, if you want to enable/play with it.  
	- At this stage of development, If you can't figure out how to enable it on your own, YOU SHOULDN'T.
- Changed the update functions a wee bit to try and reduce CPU load.  Some plates may not be updating correctly.  Complain wisely (ie. with specifics) and it shall be fixed.
- Added a selection box item to the visual elements.  find it under, theme.target


5.15
-------------


r67-68:
- Mass Update queue will now kill the other mass update requests if a full update was scheduled
- Messed about with Neon/Tank, and added some new code to test, regarding aggro and friendly unit debuffs.

r66:
- lil' Core changes

r59-r65:
- Numerous bug fixes (some of them pretty big)
- "Culling of Old Widget Code"
- Various optimizations
- Reordering of updates (Delegate functions will get updated on TidyPlates:Update() calls, regardless of the 'unit' table having changed)

The R65 release contains the test version of Graphite.

r58: 
- Lil' bug fixes

r54-57:
- Neon now keeps a "Known targetOf list" table, which delegate functions access to highlight non-tanked targets
- Added a simple Combat Log Analyzer to Debuff Widget (To report debuff cancelation back to ID'd units)
- Tank role recognition in Threat Line Widget
- Totem Icon Widget Included in WidgetLib.  Not yet in Neon.
- Changed internal cast bar code in prep for cast warning system (slated for 5.16).  oddities might occur.  I'll fix as discovered

5.14
-------------
r50-53:
- fixed nil values during set scale 
- adjusted neon font to 'Qlassik', size, and position for better clarity
- added some comments to the default theme file
- threat line widget will not update on a unit until there is a threat table; meaning, if you're solo, you won't see anything.

r47-49:
- Commented-out improved cast bar code; Saved for another cycle
- removed unit.targetOf determination; too much cpu utilization
- some optimization of the OnUpdate function to improve fading performance 
- Fixed color picker widget being placed under the interface options window
- theme.SetAlpha functions should just return a single value, for absolute alpha (0.0-1.0).  additional returns are ignored
- The theme template table (the one with all the default values) has been changed to no longer look like the Grey theme.  The Grey theme's media is now stored in its own folder.  Choosing "None" as a theme option will show name-text, only.
- TP previously tried to associate arena, party, raid member guids to a nameplate (by name).  This has been removed due to cpu considerations
- Changelog has been updated ;-)
	

r46:
- Still cranky
- fixed the Avoid overlap thingy
- added some update throttling for threat line widget
- commented out some friendly unit guid identification code

r44:
- I'm exhausted and sick and I don't want to even think about this stupid changelog thing and it's a miracle that I'm actually uploading this and I'm going to go to my freaking bed so I can be less cranky in the morning. I'm also hungry, dammit.

r43:
- Improved Fade
- Added a unit.targetOf variable, which the core will attempt to fill, depending on if there is a path to that unit (target, mousover, raid1target, party2target, etc.. doesn't fill from arena, yet)
- Added a .backdrop tag to the statusbars in the style table for themes; The image will appear behind the statusbar.

r40:

* Improved Tug-o'-Threat Widget
- Widget will try to acquire threat data from raid members

* Nameplates will now fade in when they appear

* Improved Cast Bar
- Will now try to estimate the cast of a 
unit, without being targeted.
